in an effort to motivate myself for my dissertation... and to return to my field notes after a few months hiatus...

In any case, I thought I would release every paper, project, and presentation I've done in graduate school. Because these projects likely won't see the light of day (except for when I forcibly try to drop them in everyday conversation) ___
