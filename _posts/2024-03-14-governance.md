_Note: I recently. wrote this decision about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for a former colleague and friend Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (_BIOS2_). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the meeting, I drafted a short summary of the process of creating working groups. In the time since, I've expanded it into this broader blog, expanded to account for the different stages of governance that I've gone through alongside _The Turing Way_ community._ 

# How have we formalised governance within _The Turing Way_?

Talk to anyone in the open source space (or really anyone who has experience with organisational governance, community organising, or formalisation more broadly) and they'll all say the same thing: governance is *hard*! 

I thought I’d tell you a little bit about how I've tried to go about forming working groups with The Turing Way project, and formalised work within the project more broadly. I don't want to pretend that this effort came from me alone – it's absolutely been a team effort. However, 

Keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational tasks within the project like hosting Fireside Chats, giving trainings and talks, and more. The timelines might have been different if this were my full-time focus.

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

I joined the project in March 2022, and spent the [first 6 months learning more about the project](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) in public, which you can read more about there.

This culminated in realising that there were identifiable workstreams within _The Turing Way_ that could be formalised into ‘working groups’ to help field support and agency in the growing project (and prevent the [tyranny of structurelessness]()). This came from cues from the models of other open source communities (and other forms of social organisation), such as the Kubernetes or X. This research into governance was pretty informal (like this [slide deck of research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcKjeikxAAfKDCb5Okh1EqPbabedM3c7xIVuKv1Cqeg/edit#slide=id.p)), and also formal as well (like when [we participated in the Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-5/projects-participants.html))... And it’s been a bumpy road, but a huge learning experience!

I'd like to formalise this research into a 'toolkit' that others can use, with sample ecosystem questions, interview questions for key stakeholders and community members, and graphs for 

## Phase 2: Trialling Community Governance Structures aka Working Groups and Core Team (Sept 2022 - March 2023)

After six months of research, it was time to put theory into practice. The following 6 months (Sept 2022 - March 2023) were spent working on supporting the trialing of 4 working groups: Trainers & Mentors, Reviewers & Editors, Infrastructure, and Accessibility. 

As much as I would like to say that 1+1=2, that 

These were done on different timelines. 

The 'Trainers & Mentors' and 'Reviewers & Editors' 

We also formalised a working group for Translation and Localisation, a sub-community that had formed organically in the previous two years. For groups meeting for the first time, we helped to set up their meeting infrastructure: aims, project ideas, meeting notes, and other bits and bobs. At times we gave over the reins too early (and they felt they had no support or guidance for their work), and with others, we’ve held on to the reins perhaps a bit too tightly. Looking back on that time, it became clear that this is what [moving at the speed of trust looks like](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk), to quote adrienne marie brown. 

## Phase 3: Supporting & Expanding Community Infrastructure  (March 2023 - Sept 2023)

From March 2023 to September 2023, a few changes occurred in our time. Our co-PI, Kirstie Whitaker (alongside Malvika Sharan) returned from maternity leave. We also added a new member to our team, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, who. 

I started preparing documentation needed to help with this formalisation in a templatable way for other similar groups to form working groups ([you can see a PR I finally made with some of this info here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499)!), and we also moved into a github organisation (from a repository), which has allowed different groups to [have their own spaces/repositories](https://github.com/the-turing-way). This has helped with increased autonomy and increased decentralisation of the project.

## Phase 4: Iterating and Decentralising Governance Structures (Sept 2023 - Ongoing )

From September to December 2023, we were conceptualising and planning the Book Dash, our biannual contribution event. This was a testing ground for another working group, this time oriented around a community event (like a planning committee!). We invited different community members and used this space to trial learnings from the first two working groups, with more support for meeting infrastructure. 

In January 2024: there’s a bunch of documentation and learnings to share about the whole process. Narrating it like this - it seems like we were always going to be like this, but that was definitely not the case! Hope that helps with your discussion ☺️
