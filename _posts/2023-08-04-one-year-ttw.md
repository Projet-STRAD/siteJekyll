# Reviewing (more than) one year with The Turing Way

Wow, my year-long mark with The Turing Way has come and gone. It's hard to believe that it's already been more than a year!

For those reading this blog for the first time, I joined the Alan Turing Institute last year to become Community Manager of an open source project called [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/). This followed a few years of studying open source communities as a scholar (in particular, the OpenStreetmap ecosystem), and a few fellowships & volunteer programs on open knowledge and OSINT journalism (which you can read more about here).

When I first joined The Turing Way, I was a self-identified outsider to the community, tasked with the role of "managing it" as Community Manager (whatever that might mean!). So for my first six months on the job, I did what I know how to do – employing the ethnographic tools I was trained in to learn more about the community, and documented my learnings on a weekly basis. You can read [the initial Github issue here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2318), or the [Github discussion here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) where these learnings are documented. I also wrote a six-month review [linked here](), many of things listed there I still agree with today. Right around October 2022, as I started feeling the familiar pangs of burnout, and things started accelerating schedule-wise (along with Twitter starting to impload), I stopped this practice. You'll hear a bit more about that later.

To call this past year a learning experience (both personal and professional) would be an understatement. I have oscillated between immense pride and the joy of learning, as well as confusion and exhaustion –  and I think it's all worth talking about and thinking through. I also admit that I haven't been as open as I would've liked about my experiences, in part because my own writing practice has subsided (and I am a person that writes through thinking – and thinking takes time, to put it simply). At some point, becoming a research-practitioner became primarily about what I perceived to be practice (doing the thing!), and less about research (what I increasingly thought of as 'thinking about the thing'), though of course they are intrinsically linked, while perhaps operating at different speeds. 

But in the meantime, as 2023 comes to a close, I aim to return to that practice of writing: releasing blogs on the topics listed below, as reflections from the past year or so. My hope is that returning to my own writing practice (which has, for me, always been a means of thinking-through or thinking-alongside others), might lend clarity to these questions that I've sat with!

## Why I write narratively (alt title: encountering 'documentation')

In the past year, I've encountered many different types of documentation. There's documentation for , documentation for transparency and communication, for shared, and . Writing each of these is an art form, and I admit – I don't think I

- I use a lot of 'I' language, and speak from my own perspective in order to recognise that [my own knowledge is situated](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066), as Donna Haraway wrote in 1988. This means that my perspectives are partial, grounded specifically in the context of my own experience, and cannot (and should not!) be universalised. These qualifications aren't a hedge or a disqualifier, but rather highlight the importance of context, and are a recognition of my own bias. If there are things here that resonate with your own experiences, that's great! Hopefully my own mental maps makes it easier to create yours.
- At the same time, these blogs haven't been drafted in a vacuum of my own thoughts. There have been tons of folks whose ways of thinking, mentorship, and collaboration have shaped my way of thinking about these topics. While I'll do my best to add citations to each person or situation in which I encountered an idea or way of thinking, I'll do my best to cite them.
- I'm an anthropologist/sociologist by training, which has undoubtably influenced both how I write and move through the world more broadly, the "open ecosystem" being no exception. More explicitly, I lean on [Ruth Behar's idea of the "vulnerable observer"](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/events_readings/coast_group/PNWPrag_2010_behar.pdf), the notion of ["studying up" from Laura Nader](https://www.dourish.com/classes/readings/Nader-StudyingUp.pdf), Anna Tsing's notion of "friction" being constituative of global systems, and Zapatistas' idea of a "pluriverse" (as written about by Arturo Escobar and Maria de la Cadena). There are more: for examples those that have studied infrastructures, those who have written
- This isn't the only type of documentation I'm producing within the Turing Way team, we're also producI also want to write more about the *practices* that . I think it's important to do my own reflective writing alongside these more operational tasks, because

## Reflections in progress

I chose these themes between they containerise my broader reflections above into something more structured, and help me to focus on key 

### What I've learned about/from The Turing Way

This blog is focused more on what has happened within The Turing Way, and my observations of its growth, its growing pains, and evolution over the course of the past year of being with the community. As someone that sits across

## A few prequals and post-quals I'd like to write about soon:
- What I learned from OpenStreetMap (finally need to write that OSM diary!). You can check out some of the thinking-out-load I've done at talks and things here.
- What Anthropology can learn from Open Science <> What Science can learn from Anthropology: I've been wanting to write about this for quite awhile, perhaps steeped in my own perspective, but 
- On the relationship between open science and AI: throughout the past year

## Leftovers
If you're interested in where I came from and how I got to The Turing Way, [I'm slowly stitching together notes to be turned into a different blog about that over here](https://): about anthropology and open knowledge, OpenStreetMap, the Frictionless Data project, computational arts, data journalism, soundscapes, and OSINT - the other "galaxies" I came from, so to speak... But that's for a different blog.
