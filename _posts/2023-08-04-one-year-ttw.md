# Reviewing a year (and more) with The Turing Way

Wow, my year-long mark with The Turing Way has come and gone. It's hard to believe that it's already been more than a year!

For those reading this blog for the first time, I joined the Alan Turing Institute last year to become Community Manager of an open source project called [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/). This followed a few years of studying open source communities as a scholar (in particular, the OpenStreetmap ecosystem), and a few fellowships & volunteer programs on open knowledge and OSINT journalism. 

When I first joined The Turing Way, I was a self-identified outsider to the community, tasked with the role of "managing it" as Community Manager (whatever that might mean!). So for my first six months on the job, I did what I know how to do – employing the ethnographic tools I was trained in to learn more about the community, and documented my learnings on a weekly basis. You can read [the initial Github issue here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2318), or the [Github discussion here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) where these learnings are documented. I also wrote a six-month review [linked here](https://www.aleesteele.com/blog/2022/09/22/six-months-ttw), many of things listed there I still agree with today. Right around October 2022, as I started feeling the familiar pangs of burnout, and things started accelerating operationally and schedule-wise (along with Twitter starting to impload), I stopped this practice. You'll hear a bit more about that later on.

To call this past year a learning experience (both personal and professional) would be an understatement. I have oscillated between immense pride and the joy of learning, as well as confusion and exhaustion –  and I think it's all worth talking about and thinking through. I also admit that I haven't been as open as I would've liked about my experiences, in part because my own writing practice has subsided (and I am a person that writes through thinking – and thinking takes time). At some point, becoming a research-practitioner became primarily about what I perceived to be practice (doing the thing!), and less about research (what I increasingly thought of as 'thinking about the thing'), though of course they are intrinsically linked, while perhaps operating at different speeds.

But in the meantime, as 2023 comes to a close, I aim to return to that practice of writing: releasing blogs on the topics listed below, as reflections from the past year plus. My hope is that by returning to my own writing practice (which has, for me, always been a means of thinking-through or thinking-alongside others), it might lend clarity to these questions that I've been sitting with for quite a while, and perhaps even help others too. 

## Reflections (alt title: 'why I write narratively', or encountering 'documentation')

In the past year, I've encountered many different types of documentation. There's documentation for posterity, documentation for transparency, for guidance and how-tos, for peer review, for description, for reflection, for replication, for user experience, and performance. Indeed, _The Turing Way_ itself is a documentation project. Each of these types of documentation requires a different way of thinking – and I will be the first to admit that not all of them come necessarily come naturally to me. So, I can only add a few qualitifiers about the type of writing that does and will be used here, and add a few qualifiers as to _why_ I write the way I do:

- I use a lot of 'I' language, and speak from my own perspective in order to recognise that [my own knowledge is situated](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066), as Donna Haraway wrote in 1988. This means that my perspectives are partial, grounded specifically in the context of my own experience, and cannot (and should not!) be universalised. These qualifications aren't a hedge or a disqualifier, but rather highlight the importance of context, and are a recognition of my own bias. If there are things here that resonate with your own experiences, that's great! Hopefully my own mental maps makes it easier to create yours.
- At the same time, these blogs haven't been drafted in a vacuum of my own thoughts. There have been tons of folks whose ways of thinking, mentorship, and collaboration have shaped my way of thinking about these topics. While I'll do my best to add citations to each person or situation in which I encountered an idea or way of thinking, I might miss out on a few. (Apologies in advance for that if I miss you!)
- I'm an anthropologist/sociologist by training, which has undoubtably influenced both how I write and move through the world more broadly, the "open ecosystem" being no exception. More explicitly, I lean on [Ruth Behar's idea of the "vulnerable observer"](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/events_readings/coast_group/PNWPrag_2010_behar.pdf), the notion of ["studying up" from Laura Nader](https://www.dourish.com/classes/readings/Nader-StudyingUp.pdf), Clifford Geertz' ["thick description"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick_description) (the stuff of every undergraduate/graduate curriculum), Anna Tsing's notion of ["friction"](https://publicseminar.org/2016/09/friction/) being constituative of global systems, and Zapatistas' idea of a "pluriverse" (as written about by Arturo Escobar and Maria de la Cadena). There are more, for examples those that have studied infrastructures, care, and the commons – but I was introduced to those later on, and by people I respect greatly.
- This isn't the only type of documentation I'm producing within the Turing Way team. We're also producing more operational documentation within our team(s) at the moment, particularly related to ongoing governance work and other projects. I simply think it's important to do my own reflective writing alongside these more operational and descriptive tasks, because they inform each other (at least for myself).

More than anything, I hope that this writing comes from a place of intellectual humility and deep listening – both to myself, as well as with others, and the wider times we are existing in. I like this quote from Jenny Odell, who said that it is "acts of attention that we decide who to hear, who to see, and who in our world has agency. In this way, attention forms the ground not just for love, but for ethics.” 

## Reflections in progress

I chose these themes between they containerise my broader reflections above into something more structured, and help me to focus on key themes (which yes - will include where I believe I've gone right, and what I believe I've gotten wrong!)

### What I've learned (and struggled with) while being a researcher-practitioner during times of (perpetual) crisis

Over the past year, I've had many discussions with folks about what it means to be in this space, especially in a time of deep political turmoil (within the UK and around the world). Everything we do is intertwined with these i 

### What I've learned about/from The Turing Way

In my role, I focused more on what has happened within The Turing Way, and my observations of its growth, its growing pains, and evolution over the course of the past year of being with the community. 

### What I've learned about community management (& my version of 'open leadership')

Community management is a new-ish role in the open ecosystem, though it comes in 

### What I've learned about "openness", open science & the open ecosystem

Having spent time in different 'galaxies' in the open ecosystem, 

## A few prequals and post-quals I'd like to write about soon:
- What I learned from OpenStreetMap (finally need to write that OSM diary!). You can check out some of the thinking-out-load I've done at talks and things here.
- What Anthropology can learn from Open Science <> What Science can learn from Anthropology: I've been wanting to write about this for quite awhile, perhaps steeped in my own perspective, but 
- On the relationship between open science and AI: throughout the past year
- On computational arts and computational sciences: navigating difference and cognitive dissonance

## Thank yous
Reviewing all the people and conversations had over the past year+, there are many many thank yous to give!
- To the TTW Community and team, who have been generous with their time, their . 
- To my colleagues at the Alan Turing Institute
- To the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and OpenStreetMap folks who continue to engage with. This 
- To mentors, friends, and colleagues from different fields: . I l

## Leftovers
If you're interested in where I came from and how I got to The Turing Way, I'm slowly stitching together notes to be turned into a different blog: about anthropology and open knowledge, OpenStreetMap, the Frictionless Data project, computational arts, data journalism, soundscapes, and OSINT - the other "galaxies" I came from, so to speak... But that's for a different blog.
