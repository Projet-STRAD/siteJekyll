_Note: I recently wrote this decision about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for a former colleague and friend Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (_BIOS2_). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the meeting, I drafted a short summary of the process of creating working groups. In the time since, I've expanded it into this broader blog, expanded to account for the different stages of governance that I've gone through alongside _The Turing Way_ community._ 

# How have we formalised governance within _The Turing Way_?

Talk to anyone in the open source space (or really anyone who has experience with organisational governance, community organising, or  management) and they'll all say the same thing: governance is *hard*! 

I thought I’d tell you a little bit about how I've tried to go about forming working groups with The Turing Way project, and formalised work within the project more broadly. I don't want to pretend that this effort came from me alone  – it absolutely was a team effort!

Hindsight is also always 2020. 

Keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational tasks within the project like hosting Fireside Chats (monthly in 2022, bi-monthly in 2023), giving trainings and talks, maintaining the existing repository, and institution, collaborating with internal teams at the Turing (the community management and skills teams in particular), and more. The timelines might have been different if this were my full-time focus.

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

I joined the project in March 2022, and spent the [first 6 months learning more about the project](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) which you can read more about on that issue. 

This culminated in realising that there were identifiable workstreams within the project that could be formalised into ‘working groups’ to help field support and agency in the growing project (and prevent the [tyranny of structurelessness]()), taking cues from the models of other open source communities (and other forms of social organisation). This research into governance was pretty informal (like this [slide deck of research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcKjeikxAAfKDCb5Okh1EqPbabedM3c7xIVuKv1Cqeg/edit#slide=id.p)), and also formal as well (like when [we participated in the Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-5/projects-participants.html))... And it’s been a bumpy road, but a huge learning experience! 

Pluses:
- Rapid reporting through weekly ritual
- Bottoms-up observation of community needs

Delta:
- Format for reporting was informal  
- Frequency and length of reporting lead to burnout

In the future, I'd like to formalise this research into a 'tool kit' that others can use, with sample ecosystem questions, interview questions for key stakeholders and community members that could apply more broadly to other people learning about their communities. 

## Phase 2: Trialling Community Governance Structures aka Working Groups and Core Team (Sept 2022 - March 2023)

The following 6 months (Sept 2022 - March 2023) were spent working on supporting the trialing of 4 working groups: Trainers & Mentors, Reviewers & Editors, Infrastructure, and Accessibility. These were done on different timelines. 

The 'Trainers & Mentors' and 'Reviewers & Editors' group were etablished with members of Turing staff, and other folks who had time from their paid roles to work on the project. I'm currently writing a blog about what we learned from this process - which I'll make sure to cross cite. 

We also formalised a working group for Translation and Localisation, a sub-community that had formed organically in the previous two years. We also put the pieces in place to establish a Infrastructure Working Group and Accessibility Working Group, building off of ongoing work and conversations within the community that had been observed to be ongoing. 

For groups meeting for the first time, we helped to set up their meeting infrastructure: aims, project ideas, meeting notes, and other bits and bobs. At times we gave over the reins too early (and they felt they had no support or guidance for their work), and with others, we’ve held on to the reins perhaps a bit too tightly. 

Pluses:
- Quickly established groups
- Working Group worked as organising structure

Delta:
- Support was spread too thin for new groups
- No rapid process to test feedback or iterate 

Looking back on that time, it became clear that this is what [moving at the speed of trust looks like](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk), to quote adrienne marie brown. 

## Phase 3: Supporting & Expanding Community Infrastructure  (March 2023 - Sept 2023)

From March 2023 to September 2023, I started preparing documentation needed to help with this formalisation in a template-able way for other similar groups to form working groups ([you can see a PR I finally made with some of this info here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499)!). 

Lead by the Infrastructure Working Group, we moved into a github organisation (from a repository), which has allowed different groups to [have their own spaces/repositories](https://github.com/the-turing-way) . This has helped with increased autonomy and increased decentralisation of the project.

Pluses:
- Met growing need for expansion community
- Increased autonomy for community leadership (especially working groups)

Delta:
- Maintenance responsibilities increased overall
- Decision-making process for splitting original repository not established

One of the key changes during this time was also an increase in staff: Alexandra Araujo Alvarez joined me as a Project Manager for _The Turing Way_, and it was together that we were able to support these growing pains across the project. 

## Phase 4: Iterating and Decentralising Governance Structures (Sept 2023 - February 2024 )

From September to December 2023, we were conceptualising and planning our 10th Book Dash, our biannual contribution event. 

This was a testing ground for another working group, this time oriented around this community event (like a planning committee!). We invited different community members and used this space to trial learnings from the previous working groups, and cross-community collaboration.

Pluses:
- New community reporting structure emerged (community forum)
- Book Dash Working Group-led event (our 10th Book Dash!) was a success!

Deltas:
- 


## Phase 5: Maintaining and Reporting Community Structures and Reporting (February 2024 - Ongoing)

Since February 2024, we've been in the process of maintaining the structures we currently have within the community. 

We've 

Pluses:
- New community reporting structure emerged (community forum)
- 

Deltas:

We've gone through a couple of changes in staff since then. Alex moved to a new role in an aligned project, and Aoife joined for a temporary secondment with _The Turing Way_
