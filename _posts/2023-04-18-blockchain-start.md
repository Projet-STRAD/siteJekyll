This is a **video lecture series** on the **foundations of blockchains**, given by Tim Roughgarden.

The lectures are primarily intended for those with some **computer science** background, including a familiarity with programming and mathematical concepts. Roughgarden aims to equip viewers with the tools and concepts to understand blockchain technologies and evaluate them intelligently, focusing on fundamental principles rather than nitty-gritty engineering details.

He emphasizes that this is a new area of computer science and engineering, and the opportunities for those with blockchain expertise are significant. Roughgarden hopes that the course will help viewers build something new and exciting in the upcoming years.
