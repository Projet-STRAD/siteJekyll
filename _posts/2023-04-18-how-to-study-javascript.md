Web.dev by Google is your go-to hub for modern web development best practices and user experience. Perfect for all skill levels, but if you're after in-depth documentation on HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, head to MDN.

MDN is the ultimate one-stop-shop for web developers, with extensive guides and tutorials on web technologies. Ideal for beginners and pros alike, but seasoned developers seeking niche resources may want to look elsewhere.

### More advanced stuff

Patterns.dev is your ticket to mastering software design patterns. Packed with well-structured articles and examples, it's a treasure trove for developers of all levels but may not cater to non-developers or web-dev-only folks.

The JavaScript Guide on MDN is every web developer's dream, perfect for learning or honing JavaScript skills. However, it might not be relevant for non-web-based techies or advanced JavaScript pros.

## Learn the browsers
[https://web.dev/howbrowserswork/](https://web.dev/howbrowserswork/) Web.dev's "How Browsers Work" guide is a goldmine for those eager to learn browser mechanics. Accessible and engaging, it's a must for web developers and the browser-curious, but not as relevant for non-web tech enthusiasts.
