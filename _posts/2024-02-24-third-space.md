_Note: Back in August of last year, I [wrote a blog]() that aimed to summarise some personal reflections about digital life, community management, and researcher/praxis reflections a year into my role with The Turing Way. As Jia Tolentino wrote in her book **Trick Mirror**: "I write to think", and for me, this is true as well. Journalistic or creative writing uses a very different set of muscles than documentation or academic writing, and as I kick off my second year with the project, I wanted to document these broader reflections._

# The growth of digital 'fourth spaces'

It took me a long time to realise that as a Community Manager of an open source project, I'm a steward of a kind of "digital third space", which (and I'll explain later), I've started to call a fourth space. 

The "third space" is a term coined by American sociologist Ray Oldenburg, as spaces for gathering that play a different role than home (the first place) or work (the second place). For him, third spaces were "cafes, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, hair salons and other hangouts at the heart of a community" (_The Great Good Place_, 1999). In many ways, his book highlighted the importance of third spaces in a time when they seemed to be disappearing from American life, in favor of suburbanisation and the increasing privatisaton of public spaces.

These third spaces were important, because they created social bonds and connections outside of the context of working life, labor, and the nuclear family. I love how Lia Schifitto described them in the [syllabus project](https://syllabusproject.org/third-places/): 
> "In the most basic sense, a third place is somewhere people gather that is neither the home (first place) nor for labor (second place). There is a certain magic to third places. They subvert barriers and boundaries we often accept, expanding limitations we unknowingly perpetuate. Third places exist in the in-between, a space both liminal and seemingly permanent and tangible. _They are both the site of connection but also the connection itself._"

Many urban planners, designers, and sociologists have understood this implicitely and at length. Jane Jacobs talked about the importance of "sidewalks" about the  have talk. Of course, many cities across the world continue to have vibrant "third spaces", and it would be a grave mistake to universalise the idea that all third spaces are in decline. I'm thinking of city squares (plazas) in Spanish cities, or the X of . 

Third spaces can take many forms were and continue to be: coffee shops, community gardens, churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, co-ops, pubs, parks, clubs, music venues. 

## The rise of digital third spaces and open source 'communities'

From the get go, the internet operated as a kind of "third space" for many. Hacker communities gathered, and th.


Open source similarly

## How spaces changed during the COVID-19 pandemic

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our sense of spaces. For many, the COVID-19 pandemic was the first time.

## Digital third spaces of open science and _The Turing Way_

Third spaces are very different from first and second spaces – the social norms that dictate those spaces are wildly differently. 

When I joined _The Turing Way_, the team based at the Alan Turing Institute was expanding grateful. As a part of people's roles at the Turing, they were required to 


For example: you probably wouldn't like your partner to interact with you in the same way that your line manager does, or your friend like your . 

That's not to say that fantastic friendships can't form from collaborations, but rather that the 

Open source has always blurred the line between the two. 

But what about digital "third spaces"?

## Why I call digital third spaces the "fourth space"

It was right around this time 

## Learnings from facilitating fourth spaces

### 1. People generally tend to want different things from their second and third spaces 

Faciliting a third space looks like facilitating spaces of belonging, joy,

Facilitating a second space might look like: managing expectations and people, project management. 

Last year, I spoke to my team about "professional love languages", 

In very passion-

I've also seen many friends burn out many times: 

### 2. More than ever, movements tend to be built on the blurring of the first and second space

Let's face it, the boundaries between first and second spaces have never _really_ been clear. The role of the boy's club

That's not to say that boundaries aren't bad.

What happens when the social norms of the second space blur into the second? When professional life in the second space bleeds to where you spend our free time? 

For example: the type of facilitation you need in a professional meeting is not necessarily the same 

### 3. Because digital third spaces are usually moderated by people, XXX?

## Questions 

### 1. Where do the (digital) boundaries lie between digital second and third spaces now lie?


### 2. What is the responsibility of a digital third space in the attention economy?

### 3. What is the role of privatisation in the development of third spaces?

Over the past few years, I've studied, observed, and been in volved 

This infrastructure of "public space" relates very closely to the notion of "knowledge commons" and "digita".
