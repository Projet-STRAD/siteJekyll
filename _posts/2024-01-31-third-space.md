_Note: Back in August of last year, I [wrote a blog]() that aimed to summarise some personal reflections about digital life, community management, and researcher/praxis reflections a year into my role with The Turing Way. As Jia Tolentino wrote in her book _Trick Mirror_: "I write to think", and for me, this is true as well. Journalistic or creative writing uses a very different sets of muscles than documentation or academic writing – but it's a habit I want to build this year. As I kick off my second year with the project, I wanted to add these reflections here._

# The responsibility of a third space (and the blurred spaces in between)

It took me a long time to realise that as a Community Manager of an open source project, I was a steward of a kind of "digital third space". 

The "third space" is a term coined by American sociologist Ray Oldenburg, as spaces for gathering that played a different role than the home (the first place) and from work (the second place). For him, third spaces were "cafes, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, hair salons and other hangouts at the heart of a community" (_The Great Good Place_. In many ways, his book highlighted their importance in a time when they were documented their disappearance from American life in his book, _The Great Good Place_. His book documented their disappearance in American life, with the growth of . 

These third spaces were important, because they created social bonds and connections outside of the context of other, perhaps

I love Lia Schifitto project describes them in the [syllabus project](https://syllabusproject.org/third-places/): 
> "In the most basic sense, a third place is somewhere people gather that is neither the home (first place) nor for labor (second place). There is a certain magic to third places. They subvert barriers and boundaries we often accept, expanding limitations we unknowingly perpetuate. Third places exist in the in-between, a space both liminal and seemingly permanent and tangible. _They are both the site of connection but also the connection itself._"

Many urban planners, designers, and sociologists have talked at length about the  have talk. In de

Of course, many cities across the world continue to have vibrant "third spaces", and it would be a grave. Many cultures and countries . 

Third spaces can take many forms were and continue to be: coffee shops, community gardens, churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, co-ops, pubs, parks, and music venues. 


For example: you probably wouldn't like your partner to interact with you in the same way that your line manager does, or your friend like your . 

That's not to say that fantastic friendships can't form from collaborations, but rather that the 

Open source has always blurred the line between the two. 

But what about digital "third spaces"?

For many people, open

Third spaces are very different from first and second spaces – the social norms that dictate those spaces are wildly differently. 

### The Turing Way is a first space for some, and a third space for others

When I joined _The Turing Way_, the team based at the Alan Turing Institute was expanding grateful. As a part of people's roles at the Turing, they were required to 



### Facilitating a third space is not the same as facilitating a first or second one

Faciliting a third space looks like facilitating spaces of belonging, joy,

Facilitating a second space might look like: managing expectations and people, project management. 

Last year, I spoke to my team about "professional love languages", 

### Movements are built on the blurring of the first and second space

That's not to say that boundaries aren't bad.

What happens when the social norms of the second space blur into the second? When professional life in the second space bleeds to where you spend our free time? 

For example: the type of facilitation you need in a professional meeting is not necessarily the same 

There may be an overlap
