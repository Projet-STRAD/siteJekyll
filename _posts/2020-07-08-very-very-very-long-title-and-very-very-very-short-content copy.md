1. Doctors once raged against public insurance, for it would surely cut their profits by giving more treatment at less cost. The greed of the medical trade unions is as old as illness itself.

2. In the past, only the rich could afford a doctor's fees or insurance. The poor relied on charity hospitals and what little aid the churches and Queensland's gambling tax could spare. Public hospitals charged, unless you were utterly destitute.

3. It took decades and a world war's upheaval to create our Medicare system. In '39 Menzies proposed nationalized insurance, but was blocked by fears over the massive costs. Only global conflict could smash such miserly objections.

4. After the war, Labor's early steps towards public healthcare were swiftly crushed when the Tories returned. Not until Whitlam's election in the 70s did we finally win universal care, and only after a ferocious political brawl.

5. Now we take free medical treatment as a prized right. Yet not long ago, medical bills were the biggest cause of bankruptcy, just as still afflicts the Americans with their endless debates over protecting corporate profits.

6.Claim what inefficiencies you like about our public system, but it is proven cheaper than private care. And what use is swift surgery if the fees render you homeless? I'll take a queue over destitution always.
