_Note: I recently. wrote this decision about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for a former colleague and friend Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (_BIOS2_). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the decision, I shared this blog that I've published here as well. I've expanded this blog to account for different stages of governance _ 

# How have we formalised governance within _The Turing Way_?

I thought I’d tell you a little bit about how I've tried to go about forming working groups with The Turing Way project, and formalised work within the project more broadly. I don't want to pretend that this effort came from me alone 

Hindsight is always 

Keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational. The timelines might have been different if there 

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

I joined the project in March 2022, and spent the [first 6 months learning more about the project](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) which you can read more about there. 

This culminated in realising that there were identifiable workstreams within the project that could be formalised into ‘working groups’ to help field support and agency in the growing project (and prevent the [tyranny of structurelessness]()), taking cues from the models of other open source communities (and other forms of social organisation). This research into governance was pretty informal (like this [slide deck of research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcKjeikxAAfKDCb5Okh1EqPbabedM3c7xIVuKv1Cqeg/edit#slide=id.p)), and also formal as well (like when [we participated in the Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-5/projects-participants.html))... And it’s been a bumpy road, but a huge learning experience!

I'd like to formalise this research into a 'tool kit' that others can use, with sample ecosystem questions, interview questions for key stakeholders and community members, and 

## Phase 2: Trialling Community Governance Structures aka Working Groups and Core Team (Sept 2022 - March 2023)

This 
The following 6 months (Sept 2022 - March 2023) were spent working on supporting the trialing of 4 working groups: Trainers & Mentors, Reviewers & Editors, Infrastructure, and Accessibility. These were done on different timelines. 

The 'Trainers & Mentors' and 'Reviewers & Editors' 

We also formalised a working group for Translation and Localisation, a sub-community that had formed organically in the previous two years. For groups meeting for the first time, we helped to set up their meeting infrastructure: aims, project ideas, meeting notes, and other bits and bobs. At times we gave over the reins too early (and they felt they had no support or guidance for their work), and with others, we’ve held on to the reins perhaps a bit too tightly. Looking back on that time, it became clear that this is what [moving at the speed of trust looks like](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk), to quote adrienne marie brown. 

## Phase 3: Supporting & Expanding Community Infrastructure  (March 2023 - Sept 2023)

From March 2023 to September 2023, I started preparing documentation needed to help with this formalisation in a templatable way for other similar groups to form working groups ([you can see a PR I finally made with some of this info here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499)!), and we also moved into a github organisation (from a repository), which has allowed different groups to [have their own spaces/repositories](https://github.com/the-turing-way). This has helped with increased autonomy and increased decentralisation of the project.

## Phase 4: Iterating and Decentralising Governance Structures (Sept 2023 - Ongoing )

From September to December 2023, we were conceptualising and planning the Book Dash, our biannual contribution event. This was a testing ground for another working group, this time oriented around a community event (like a planning committee!). We invited different community members and used this space to trial learnings from the first two working groups, with more support for meeting infrastructure. 

In January 2024: there’s a bunch of documentation and learnings to share about the whole process. Narrating it like this - it seems like we were always going to be like this, but that was definitely not the case! Hope that helps with your discussion ☺️
