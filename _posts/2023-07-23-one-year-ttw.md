# Reviewing one year with The Turing Way

Wow, my year-long mark with The Turing Way has come and gone. It's hard to believe that it's already been more than a year!

For those reading this blog for the first time, I joined the Alan Turing Institute last year to become Community Manager of an open source project called [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/). This followed a few years of studying open source communities as a scholar (in particular, the OpenStreetmap ecosystem), and a few fellowships & volunteer programs on open knowledge and OSINT journalism (which you can read more about here).

When I first joined The Turing Way, I was an self-identified outsider to the community, tasked with the role of "managing it" as Community Manager (whatever that might mean!). So for my first six months on the job, I did what I know how to do – employing the ethnographic tools I was trained in to learn more about the community, and documented my learnings on a weekly basis. You can read [the initial Github issue here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2318), or the [Github discussion here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) where these learnings are documented. I also  wrote a six-month review [linked here](), many of things listed there I still agree with today. Right around October 2022, as I started feeling the familiar pangs of burnout, and things started accelerating schedule-wise (along with Twitter starting to impload), I stopped this practice. You'll hear a bit more about that later.

To call this past year a learning experience (both personal and professional) would be an understatement. I have oscillated between immense pride and the joy of learning, as well as confusion and exaustion –  and I think it's all worth talking about and thinking through. I also admit that I don't think I've been as open as I would've liked about my experiences, in part because my own writing practice has subsided. At some point, becoming a research-practitioner became primarily about what I perceived to be practice (doing the thing!), and less about research (what I increasingly thought of as 'thinking about the thing'), though of course they are intrinsically linked, while perhaps operating at different speeds. 

During the month of August 2023, I am to returning to that practice of weekly writing at the one-year point (or perhaps a little bit past that!). My hope is that returning to my own writing practice (which has, for me, always been a means of thinking-through or thinking-alongside), might lend clarity to these questions!

## Why I write narratively (alt title: encountering 'documentation')

In the past year, I've encountered many different 

- I use a lot of 'I' language, and speak from my own perspective in order to recognise that [my own knowledge is situated](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066), as Donna Haraway wrote in 1988. This means that my perspectives are partial, grounded specifically in the context of my own experience, and cannot (and should not!) be universalised. These qualifications aren't a hedge or a disqualifier, but rather highlight the importance of contextualisation, and a recognition of my own bias. If there are things here that resonate with your own experiences, that's great! Hopefully my own mental maps makes it easier to create yours. 
- At the same time, these blogs haven't been drafted in a vacuum of my own thoughts. There have been tons of folks whose ways of thinking, mentorship, and X have 
- I'm an anthropologist/sociologist by training, which has undoubtably influenced both how I write and move through the world more broadly, the "open ecosystem" being no exception. More explicitly, I lean on [Ruth Behar's idea of the "vulnerable observer"](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/events_readings/coast_group/PNWPrag_2010_behar.pdf), the notion of ["studying up" from Laura Nader](https://www.dourish.com/classes/readings/Nader-StudyingUp.pdf), Anna Tsing's notion of "friction" being constituative of global systems, and Zapatistas' idea of a "pluriverse" (as written about by Arturo Escobar and Maria de la Cadena. There are more: for examples those that have studied infrastructures,

## Reflecting

I chose these themes between they containerise my broader reflections above into something more: 

### What I've learned about/from The Turing Way

This blog is focused more on what has happened within The Turing Way, and my observations of its growth, its growing pains, and evolution over the course of the past year of being with the community. Of course, this likely ties back to longer

### What I've learned about Community Management (& 'Open Leadership')

In my drafts so far, this blog has reflected more broadly

### What I've learned about "openness" & the open ecosystem

Having spent time in different 'gallexies' in the open

## A few prequals I'd like to write about soon:
- What I learned from OpenStreetMap (finally need to write that OSM diary!). You can check out some of the thinking-out-load I've done at talks and things here.
- What Anthropology can learn from Open Science <> What Science can learn from Anthropology: I've been wanting to write about this for quite awhile, perhaps steeped in my own

## Leftovers
If you're interested in where I came from and how I got to The Turing Way, [I'm slowly stitching together notes to be turned into a different blog about that over here](https://): about anthropology and open knowledge, OpenStreetMap, the Frictionless Data project, computational arts, data journalism, soundscapes, and OSINT - the other "galaxies" I came from, so to speak... But that's for a different aim!

, my usual place to document thoughts on the fly started to impload), I stopped documenting on a weekly basis. This left more room for operational tasks & responsibilities, but that didn't mean that I stopped learning. In fact, it's taken me more than a year to learn how important this kind of ongoing, open documentation practice actually is: especially as Community Manager of a collective documentation project.
