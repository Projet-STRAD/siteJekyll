# 404 - nothing found

taking cues from [my friend jonathan's 404](https://jonathangray.org/404), i'm adding this here instead:

The uses of not

Thirty spokes
meet in the hub.
Where the wheel isn’t
is where it’s useful.

Hollowed out,
clay makes a pot.
Where the pot’s not
is where it’s useful.

Cut doors and windows
to make a room.
Where the room isn’t,
there’s room for you.

So the profit in what is
is in the use of what isn’t.

– Ursula Le Guin’s [translation](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/lao-tzu-the-tao-te-ching) of the Tao Te Ching, [§6](https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md#the-uses-of-not).
