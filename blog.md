this blog, as i wrote [here](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1687410000329678851) and [here](https://post.lurk.org/@aleesteele/110830839366429110), is something that i am slowly aiming to return to, and more carefully curate. i haven't had a regular blog in years – but believe that a regular writing. 

why don't i use an existing platform like medium or substack, that perhaps might make these posts easier to share?
