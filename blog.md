this blog, as i wrote [here](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1687410000329678851) and [here](https://post.lurk.org/@aleesteele/110830839366429110) is something that i am slowly aiming to return to, and more carefully tend to. i haven't had a regular blog in years, choosing instead to write long emails to friends, family, and other loved ones. these days,Â i don't write as many long emails, but i still believe that a regular writing & reflection practice is important, perhaps as opposed to (or perhaps just in parallel) to the kind of sporatic note-taking and sparks of inspiration i tend to add to my <a href="https://notes.aleesteele.com/">digital garden</a> or [are.na](https://www.are.na/anne-lee-steele). ~~~while i may use or feed into a platform like substack or medium in the future, for now i just like putting these small posts out into the world. ~~~

a friend recently recommended that i have some kind of subscription format, to make it easier for folks to be alerted when there are updates to this blog. feel free to subscribe here:
<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/aleesteele"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/aleesteele', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
  style="border:1px; background-color:#ffffff;"
>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" /> 
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>

enjoy! if you have any questions, suggestions, or reflections of your own, send me an email at [aleesteele@gmail.com](mailto:aleesteele@gmail.com)
