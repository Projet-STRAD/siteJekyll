# biography:

I'm a writer, researcher, and designer based in Geneva, Switzerland.

I'm currently a MA candidate at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, and a <a href="https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/" class="bio-link" photo_url="frictionless.png">Reproducible Research Fellow</a> at the Open Knowledge Foundation. In my free time, I curate <a href="https://www.supply-chains.us/" class="bio-link" photo_url="supply-chains.png">supply-chains.us</a> and <a href="https://open-source-social-science.github.io/" class="bio-link" photo_url="open-source-social-science.png">open-source-social-science</a>.

I'm interested in the people &amp; processes behind our digital lives (think: open source software, humanitarian tech, and supply chains). For me, this means working between disciplines, using modern tools to keep it accessible, and applying theory to practice. I also try to publish [rough drafts](blog) and <a href="https://notes.aleesteele.com/" class="bio-link" photo_url="anne.png">notes</a> regularly.

Before moving to Switzerland, I researched conservation in Bhutan, co-led student expeditions in Nepal, and coded data visualizations for a Washington DC think tank. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict. I also designed media for different organizations in New York City.

When I'm not on a computer, I'm usually outside.
